    <h2>Why Dogs Don’t Age Linearly</h2>
    <p>The traditional “multiply by 7” rule was never biologically accurate.</p>
    <p>DNA methylation studies (UC San Diego, 2019) revealed dogs age rapidly in their first two years, then slow down. Veterinary associations now align life stages using this curve combined with breed size.</p>
    <h3>What this calculator uses</h3>
    <ul>
  <li>Logarithmic early-life ageing</li>
  <li>Breed-size acceleration after age 2</li>
  <li>AAHA life-stage definitions</li>
</ul>
    <p>This approach reflects how veterinarians evaluate health risk — not myths.</p>
