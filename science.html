<h2>Why Dogs Don’t Age Linearly</h2>
<p>The traditional “multiply by 7” rule was never biologically accurate.</p>

<p>DNA methylation studies (UC San Diego, 2019) revealed dogs age rapidly in their first two years, then slow down. Veterinary associations now align life stages using this curve combined with breed size.</p>

<h3>What this calculator uses</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Logarithmic early-life ageing</li>
  <li>Breed-size acceleration after age 2</li>
  <li>AAHA life-stage definitions</li>
</ul>

<p>This approach reflects how veterinarians evaluate health risk — not myths.</p>

  <h2>Dog Age Questions People Ask</h2>

  <details>
    <summary>How old is my dog in human years?</summary></summary>
    <p>Dogs age faster than humans during their first two years.
This calculator converts dog age into human years using modern veterinary life-stage data rather than the outdated ×7 rule.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Is the ×7 dog age rule accurate?</summary>
    <p>No.
The ×7 rule is a myth and does not reflect biological ageing.
Veterinary research shows dogs age on a logarithmic curve.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Do dogs age faster than humans?</summary>
    <p>Yes.
Dogs mature rapidly in early life and then age more slowly, depending on breed size and genetics.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Do large dogs age faster than small dogs?</summary>
    <p>Yes.
Large and giant breeds age faster after their second year compared to small and toy breeds.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Why do dogs age so fast?<summary>
    <p>Dogs age quickly due to differences in metabolism, genetics, and lifespan compared to humans.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Is this dog age calculator accurate?</summary>
    <p>This calculator uses veterinary life-stage guidelines and DNA-age research to estimate realistic human-age equivalents.</p>
  </details>

      <details>
    <summary>Can I calculate my puppy’s human age?</summary>
    <p>Yes.
Puppies age extremely fast during their first year, which is why early veterinary care is critical.</p>
  </details>

       <details>
    <summary>Is dog age calculation the same for all breeds?</summary>
    <p>No.
Breed size and genetics significantly affect how dogs age, especially after two years.</p>
  </details>
<details>
    <summary>Why does my dog seem old at only 7 years?</summary>
    <p>Many dogs reach senior life stages earlier than expected, particularly medium to large breeds.</p>
