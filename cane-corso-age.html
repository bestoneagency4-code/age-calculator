    <h2>Expected Lifespan</h2>
    <p>The average Cane Corso lifespan is <strong>9-12 years</strong>, typical for giant breeds. Factors affecting longevity:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Genetics:</strong> Responsible breeding reduces hereditary diseases</li>
      <li><strong>Diet:</strong> High-quality nutrition prevents obesity</li>
      <li><strong>Exercise:</strong> Moderate daily activity (1 hour minimum)</li>
      <li><strong>Preventive Care:</strong> Annual vet checkups, vaccinations, parasite control</li>
      <li><strong>Weight Management:</strong> Obesity shortens lifespan by 2+ years</li>

    <h3>Critical Health Watchlist</h3>
    <p>Cane Corsos are predisposed to specific conditions. Early detection saves lives.</p>
    
    <div class="health-grid">
        <div class="health-item">
            <strong>Hip & Elbow Dysplasia</strong>
            <p>Malformed joints causing arthritis. Affects 20-40% of breed. Symptoms: limping, difficulty rising, reluctance to jump. Prevention: maintain lean weight, avoid excessive jumping before 18 months.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="health-item">
            <strong>Bloat (Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus)</strong>
            <p>Life-threatening stomach twisting. Deep-chested breeds at highest risk. Symptoms: distended abdomen, unproductive vomiting, restlessness. <strong>Emergency surgery required within hours.</strong> Prevention: slow feeders, avoid exercise after meals, multiple small meals.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="health-item">
            <strong>Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM)</strong>
            <p>Heart muscle weakening. Often asymptomatic until advanced stages. Annual cardiac screening recommended after age 5. Symptoms: coughing, fatigue, fainting.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="health-item">
            <strong>Cherry Eye</strong>
            <p>Prolapsed third eyelid gland. Common in mastiffs. Causes red mass in corner of eye. Requires surgical correction to prevent chronic dry eye.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="health-item">
            <strong>Entropion</strong>
            <p>Eyelids roll inward, causing corneal damage. Signs: excessive tearing, squinting, eye redness. Surgical correction necessary.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="health-item">
            <strong>Demodectic Mange</strong>
            <p>Mite infestation causing hair loss. Cane Corsos have genetic susceptibility. Not contagious to humans but requires veterinary treatment.</p>

    <h3>Cane Corso FAQ</h3>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h4>When is a Cane Corso fully grown?</h4>
      <p>Height is reached by 12-15 months, but physical maturity isn't complete until 18-24 months when chest and shoulders fill out. Males may continue developing muscle until age 3.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h4>Are Cane Corsos good family dogs?</h4>
      <p>With proper socialization, yes—but they're <strong>not for first-time owners.</strong> They require experienced handling, consistent training, and supervision with children. Their size and strength demand respect. Not recommended for homes with very young children.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h4>How much exercise does a Cane Corso need?</h4>
      <p>Adults need minimum 1 hour daily. This includes walks, play, and mental stimulation (training, puzzle toys). Puppies under 18 months should avoid high-impact activities (jumping, long runs) to protect developing joints.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h4>Do Cane Corsos drool a lot?</h4>
      <p>Yes. Mastiff breeds have loose jowls that collect saliva. Drooling increases after drinking, eating, or excitement. This is normal anatomy, not a health issue. Keep towels handy.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h4>Are Cane Corsos aggressive?</h4>
      <p>Not inherently, but poor breeding, lack of socialization, or abuse creates dangerous dogs. Properly raised Corsos are stable, confident guardians. However, their protective instincts and power make them unsuitable for inexperienced owners or those wanting a "social" dog.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h4>How much does it cost to own a Cane Corso?</h4>
      <p>Initial purchase: $1,500-$4,000 from reputable breeders. Annual costs: Food ($800-1,500), vet care ($500-1,200), insurance ($720-1,200). Emergency surgeries can exceed $5,000-10,000.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h4>Can Cane Corsos live in apartments?</h4>
      <p>Not ideal. While calm indoors, they need space to patrol and stretch. Require daily outdoor access, structured exercise, and mental stimulation. Bored Corsos become destructive.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h4>What should I feed my Cane Corso?</h4>
      <p>Adults: 4-8 cups high-quality food daily, split into 2 meals. Puppies require large-breed puppy formula to control growth rate (fast growth increases dysplasia risk). Avoid calcium supplementation. Consult vet for specific recommendations.</p>
