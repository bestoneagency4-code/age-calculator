    <h3>Critical Health Watchlist</h3>
    <p>As a Large Breed, GSDs have specific vulnerabilities. Prevention is key to a long life.</p>
    
    <div class="health-grid">
        <div class="health-item">
            <strong>Joint Health (Dysplasia)</strong>
            <p>20% of GSDs face hip or elbow issues. Avoid high-impact jumping until 18 months old.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="health-item">
            <strong>The "Silent" Danger (Bloat)</strong>
            <p>Deep-chested breeds can suffer stomach twisting. Use slow feeders and avoid exercise after meals.</p>

    <h3>German Shepherd FAQ</h3>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h4>When is a German Shepherd "fully grown"?</h4>
      <p>Height is usually reached by 12 months, but they are not physically "mature" until 2 to 2.5 years when their chest and shoulders fill out.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h4>Why is my puppy so "mouthy"?</h4>
      <p>GSDs are a "herding" breed, often called "Land Sharks" as puppies. They use their mouths to explore. Consistent bite-inhibition training is vital before 6 months.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h4>How much exercise do they actually need?</h4>
      <p>An adult GSD needs 1-2 hours of daily activity. This must include <strong>mental work</strong> (scent games, advanced commands) or they may become destructive.</p>
